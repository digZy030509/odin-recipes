    <h2>How to Make Apple Pie Filling</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the apple pie filling recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>Apple Pie Filling Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this apple pie filling recipe: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apples</strong>: The best apples for apple pie are firm and sweet-tart. Granny Smith apples are always a great choice. Some bakers prefer using Granny Smith apples in combination with a slightly sweeter variety, such as Honeycrisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: Toss the sliced apples with lemon juice to keep them from browning prematurely. </li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: The stovetop apple pie filling starts with 10 cups of water. </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Of course, this recipe calls for white sugar! You’ll need 4 ½ cups, to be exact. </li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong>: A cup of cornstarch thickens the filling. </li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your apple pie taste salty. </li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>: Ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg add flavor and warmth to the apple pie filling. </li>
    </ul>
